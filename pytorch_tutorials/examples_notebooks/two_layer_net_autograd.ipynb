        "\nPyTorch: Variables and autograd\n-------------------------------\n\nA fully-connected ReLU network with one hidden layer and no biases, trained to\npredict y from x by minimizing squared Euclidean distance.\n\nThis implementation computes the forward pass using operations on PyTorch\nVariables, and uses PyTorch autograd to compute gradients.\n\nA PyTorch Variable is a wrapper around a PyTorch Tensor, and represents a node\nin a computational graph. If x is a Variable then x.data is a Tensor giving its\nvalue, and x.grad is another Variable holding the gradient of x with respect to\nsome scalar value.\n\nPyTorch Variables have the same API as PyTorch tensors: (almost) any operation\nyou can do on a Tensor you can also do on a Variable; the difference is that\nautograd allows you to automatically compute gradients.\n\n"
