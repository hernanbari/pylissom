Pylissom
========

Pylissom is a Pytorch extension implementing the Lissom network and other tools, based in the topographica framework.

It's split in two parts, the core nn and optim packages, which implement the network itself,
 and the datasets, models and utils packages, that consist of a researcher's toolkit akin to topographica features.
